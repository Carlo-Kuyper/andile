# Coffee Code: A Developer-Themed E-commerce Site

Welcome to Coffee Code, the e-commerce platform where coffee meets code! This project is designed for coffee lovers with a passion for development, offering a unique blend of high-quality coffee products with a nerdy, developer-themed twist. Whether you're looking for your next favorite coffee blend or some developer-themed coffee accessories, Coffee Code has something for every tech enthusiast.

## Technologies Used

Coffee Code is built using the MERN stack, a popular set of technologies known for its efficiency and scalability in web development. Here's a breakdown of the stack:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing product and user data in a flexible, schema-less format.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build our server-side logic and API endpoints.
- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building the user interface, particularly the dynamic and interactive elements of our e-commerce platform.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code server-side, allowing us to build a fast and scalable network application.

## Features

- **Product Browsing**: Users can browse through a variety of coffee products and developer-themed accessories.
- **Search Functionality**: A dynamic search feature allows users to quickly find products that match their interests.
- **Order Management**: Users can place orders, and admins can manage these orders through a dedicated dashboard.

## Getting Started

To get Coffee Code up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. MongoDB should be installed and running as well.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/coffee-code.git
cd coffee-code


2. **Install dependencies for the server:**

bash
npm install

3. **Install dependencies for the client:**

Navigate to the client directory and install the required packages.

bash
cd client
npm install

4. **Configure your environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. You'll need to specify your MongoDB URI and any other environment-specific variables here.

Example `.env` file:

plaintext
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/coffee-code
PORT=5000

### Starting the Project

1. **Start the backend server:**

From the root directory of the project, run:

bash
npm start


2. **Start the React frontend:**

In a new terminal window, navigate to the client directory and start the React app:

bash
cd client
npm start

Your default web browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`, where you'll be greeted by the Coffee Code homepage.
